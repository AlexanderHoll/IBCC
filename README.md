# IBCC - Lancaster Bomber Simulator

A lancaster bomber command simulator.

The aim of the project was to build an interactive museum exhibit, in conjunction with the IBCC (International Bomber Command Centre). This exhibit was built at the University of Lincoln, as part of a second year group project. Initial goals saw a number of people playing cooperatively, with each user adopting a role of the bomber. Functioning roles include:
* Pilot
* Gunner
* Bomber

Each role relies on one another: the pilot needs to navigate so the bomber can hit targets, the gunner needs to protect the plane from enemy pilots that have the potential to destroy the plane and the bomber needs to bomb all targets if the users are to successfully complete their mission.
*Unity game engine required*

Setup:
1. Firstly download Unity.
2. Open folder with Unity and it should import all assets to be able to run.
3. Final Scene is in the Scene folder, the finalised scene is just called: Scene.
